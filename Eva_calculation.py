# Step 0
    # Write a main function for testing purposes

    # Use SQLite to pull data from .db database
    # Perform calculation to the data
    # Store (write out) the calculated data to a file as text

# Step 2 - Graph
# Write another function that can be called from main.py. This function will:
    # Read from text file created from step1
    # Use matplot/plotly to graph the results
